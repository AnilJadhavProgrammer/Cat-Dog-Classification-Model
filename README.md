# Cat-Dog-Classification-Model
# Overview
This project is a deep learning model that classifies images as either cats or dogs. this model showcases key concepts in Computer Vision and Deep Learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
# Features
- Classifies images as cat or dog
- Implements image preprocessing and augmentation for better accuracy
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction
- Provides high accuracy on a labeled dataset

# Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
# Dataset
The model is trained on the [mention dataset, e.g., Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Dataset].
- Publicly available dataset: Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Dataset
- Custom dataset: Users can provide their own labeled images.

# Preprocessing Steps:
- Image resizing and normalization
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, etc.)
- Splitting into training and validation sets
# Model Architecture
The Cat & Dog Classification model consists of:

- Convolutional Layers - Extracts features from images
- Pooling Layers - Reduces dimensions while retaining key features
- Fully Connected Layers (Dense) - Classifies image as cat or dog
- Softmax Activation - Outputs probability scores for each class

# Key Parameters:

- Image Size: [e.g., 128x128]
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Batch Size: 32
- Epochs: [e.g., 10-20]
# Training
Steps to train the model:
- Split dataset into training and validation sets
- Define the CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras
- Compile the model:
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
- Train the model:
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=10, batch_size=32)
# Usage
- Run the script to classify an image:
python predict.py --image sample.jpg
- Output Example:
Prediction: This is a Dog üê∂
# Results
üìä Achieved [92]% accuracy on the test dataset.

- Example Predictions:
üîπ Input: Image of a cat ‚Üí Prediction: "Cat üê±"
üîπ Input: Image of a dog ‚Üí Prediction: "Dog üê∂"
